    <h2>Kristian Martinez</h2>
      <p>My Name is Kristian Martinez, and I am an 21 year old Filipino artist studying graphic design and film at the 
        University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I specialize in logo design, poster design, motion graphics, and animation. 
        Born and raised in Las Vegas, my history with art has gone back to the earliest days of my childhood. Whether
        it was the countless movies I watched as a kid or the stacks of papers filled with drawings, I knew the art of
        storytelling was for me.</p>
      <p>With countless of elementary, middle school, and high school art awards I've received, I was always dubbed as
        "the art kid" in his class. As I grew up my skills in the art not only grew with me but expanded as well. I have
        gotten more and more proficient in tools such as Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Davinci Resolve, and Blender,
        but even with three years of various technical experiences under my belt, I am always striving to learn new skills
        and softwares.</p>
      <p>For the past three years I have been a freelance graphic designer, animator, and motion graphics artist. As a
        graphic designer, I have designed short-film posters, album covers, and logos in the Las Vegas and Phoenix film
        communities. As an filmmaker and storyteller, I strive to push the boundaries of film and animated storytelling
        through the lense my experiences on life. Currently, I am an award winning director and animator with my animated
        short film <i>Homing Pigeon</i>.</p>
